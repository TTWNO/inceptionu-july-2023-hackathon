# InceptionU Hackathon July 2023

* Create a common data format to convert to:
  * SVG
  * SVG (tactile diagram)
  * HTML
  * `<table>`
* Limitations
  * Data needs to be within the same order of magnintute (i.e., no support for logarithmic y axis)
  * No colour-blind palette
  * Uses JS
  * Lots of fixed values that aren't constified
  * Font size is small
